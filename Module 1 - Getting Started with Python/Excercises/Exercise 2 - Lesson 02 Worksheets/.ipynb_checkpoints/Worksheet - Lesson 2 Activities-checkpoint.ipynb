    "1. Demonstrate the use of a variety of data types in Python, including numbers, booleans, and strings.\n",
    "1. Distinguish between float values, integers, and complex numbers.\n",
    "1. Use Python to perform operations using numbers.\n",

    "1. Use Python to manipulate string values.\n",
